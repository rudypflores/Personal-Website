				<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
				<p>I'm a passionate self-taught programmer born in <b>Manhattan, New York</b>, and raised in <b>Guatemala City, Guatemala</b>. I found my passion for coding by learning from my uncle that graduated as an IT and showed me the abstraction of coding. As well as giving me a basic understanding of how a problem can be solved in not one but many different ways. I taught myself to code through <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn">Codecademy</a> through their <b>Java</b> courses and <b>Web Development Path's</b> that they provide for members with the pro version. Most importantly, enabiling their users to work on personal projects where they can help you grow as a programmer.</p>
