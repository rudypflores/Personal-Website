        <p class="description">
            Ongoing research project where the study involves analyzing the efficiency between a user taking a test in different 
            topics with a set of genres of music, as well as taking these tests without music at all. Development tasks for creating
            the platform are currently the following: 
            <ul>
                <li>Development of a front-end for the users to see and use through vanilla HTML/CSS/Javascript</li>
                <li>Creation of an API and back-end for handling the sending of data as well as storing</li>
                <li>Integration of event driven programming for interactive UI</li>

            In the Computer Science Society (CSS), we strive to reach out to the Computer Science community
            in the Northeastern Illinois University (NEIU) with the goal of helping newer programmers understand
            keypoints of the industry. These keypoints being things like for example:
            <ul>
                <li>Whiteboarding workshops & Mock interviews</li>
                <li>Javascript/React workshops</li>
