# Personal-Website
Personal website that I created during my freetime in order to show my portfolio and provide users a nice and responsive experience.

Upcoming features for this website in the following weeks will include:

  - Dynamic interface.
  - Integration of Flexboxes and possibly Handlebars.js.
  - Implementation of JQuery for easier readability in regards to JS DOM events.
  - Eye catching animations through CSS @Keyframe feature!
